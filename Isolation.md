What does this mean?  
  
MR RAINER  
This, AINU friend, is the frequency you speak on.  
  
MR RAINER  
There are only three frequencies on HJÖ: Ä, Ü and Ö.  
  
MR RAINER  
Ü and Ä are interpreted by 98% of the entire population of HJÖ, so you're the majority!  
  
ÜLAR  
What happens to the remaining 2%?  
  
MR RAINER  
Others cannot hear them.

	- The isolation of not being heard, of not being able me make yourself understood. It reminds me of that [[52-heartz whale]], who sang in a unique frequency and was forever in isolation
